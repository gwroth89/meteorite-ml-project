# meteorite-ml-project

Project proposal:

We plan to build a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of finding a meteorite based on a comprehensive dataset from the meteorological society. We ultimately hope to build a web app that allows you to enter a geolocation that returns the likelihood of a meterotie falling being found.
